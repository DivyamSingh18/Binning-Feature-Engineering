# Binning-Feature-Engineering

Data binning or bucketing is a data pre-processing method used to minimize the effects of observation errors. Binning is the process of transforming numerical variables into categorical counterparts. Binning improves accuracy of the predictive models by reducing the noise or non-linearity in the dataset. Binning also helps in easy identification of outliers, invalid values and missing values of numerical variables.

Binning is a quantization technique in Machine Learning to handle continuous variables. It is one of the important steps in Data Wrangling.


## Types of Binning
* Unsupervised Binning :
1. Equal width binning<br>
2. Equal frequency binning<br>

* Supervised Binning:
1. Entropy-based binning <br>
